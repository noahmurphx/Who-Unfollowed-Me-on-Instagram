# Who-Unfollowed-Me-on-Instagram
This simple Python script will let you know who you follow that does not follow you back without risking your account getting banned like third party apps.

1.) Save the script to your computer.
2.) Go to your Instagram account on your phone > Profile > Settings and activity > Search "Download" with search bar in settings. > Click "Download your information" > Click "Download or Transfer information" > Select your Instagram profile > Select "Some of your information" > Scroll down and check "Followers and following" > select "Download to device" > Change date range to "All time" and finally click create files.
After several minutes you will get an email from Instagram able to download the file, save that file to a location on your computer. (I keep mine within a folder for better desktop organization)
3.) Edit in notepad under the line "#edit file path" and edit path location to the location on your computer for both followers_file and followings_file. All you need to edit is the lines up to FileName. Leave \connections\followers_and_follwing\etc...
Save the script from as a .py file and run it!
It will no list the accounts that you follow that do not follow you back without any issues or risk of getting your Instagram account banned like all the third party apps do :)
To run script with updated follower and following list simply download your information from Instagram and replace the connections file in your folder!
